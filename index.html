                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Robert Mason and I am a legislative and election consultant
                    with more than five years experience work in both the private and public sectors. After graduating with a degree in
                    political science in 2014, I worked for the California State Assembly for three elected members in both their district offices
                    and at the Capitol Building in Sacramento. Since 2017, I have worked as an legislative consultant for organizations
                    seeking expertise on introducting and moving legislation through the California Legislature including the California
                    Atheltic Trainers Association, CalEEC, and the Union of Concerned Scientists. My work has also
                    involved providing strategy and experience to prospective candidates seeking elected office in both California and
                    Nevada and conducting targeted focus groups on their behalf. I am presently learning to become a full stack programmer with the intention of shifting into the realm on conducting
                    independent polling operations and becoming a more data-centric political consultant.</p>
